🧠 Overview

Finding Donors for CharityML elevates the classic income classification problem into a socially responsible, AI-powered donation intelligence platform for NGOs and non-profits.

Instead of merely predicting income, the system identifies potential donors, estimates donation capacity, and generates fair, explainable insights to help organizations connect with the right people at the right time.

> 💡 From income prediction to social impact — powered by ethical AI.




---

🎯 Objectives

Develop a Donation Prediction System estimating the likelihood and potential donation amount.

Introduce a Smart Donation Index (SDI) — a metric that combines socioeconomic factors to quantify donation readiness.

Build a transparent and fair ML pipeline using explainable AI tools (SHAP, LIME).

Design an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI) for non-technical charity admins.

Achieve real-world deployment readiness for NGOs and non-profit platforms.

🧮 Mathematical Formulation

Smart Donation Index (SDI) is defined as:

SDI = \sigma(w_1 \cdot Income + w_2 \cdot Education + w_3 \cdot HoursPerWeek - w_4 \cdot Dependents)

Where:

: Sigmoid function (normalizes output to [0, 1])

: Feature weights derived from model importance

Output: Probability of donation readiness



---

🧩 Project Flow

1️⃣ Data Exploration – Understand feature relationships and income patterns

2️⃣ Data Preparation – Handle missing values, encode categoricals

3️⃣ Feature Engineering – Create SDI and socio-economic features

4️⃣ Model Training – Compare models (LogReg, RF, XGBoost, LGBM)

5️⃣ Explainability – Interpret model reasoning via SHAP/LIME

6️⃣ Evaluation – Measure F1, ROC-AUC, and fairness metrics


---

⚙ Modeling & Evaluation

Model	F1-Score	ROC-AUC	Notes

Logistic Regression	0.88	0.93	Baseline model
Random Forest	0.90	0.95	Robust generalization
XGBoost (Final)	0.91	0.96	Best performance


Bias: < 2% across demographic groups

Fairness Metrics: Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity

📊 Dashboard & Visualization

✅ Donation Probability Heatmaps

✅ SHAP Summary & Force Plots

✅ Smart Donation Index Distribution

✅ Donor Segmentation Filters

✅ Region-Based Donor Rankings


---

⚖ Ethical Considerations

Ensures algorithmic fairness through demographic parity checks

Avoids income or gender discrimination using balanced sampling

Provides transparent explanations for every prediction

Supports AI for Good principles for responsible social deployment



---

🧑‍💼 For Non-Technical Users

This system helps charities identify and prioritize donors ethically and transparently.
Users can explore the dashboard to:

View donation likelihood per person/region

Understand why someone is marked as a potential donor

Make data-driven outreach decisions without coding knowledge



---

🧑‍🔬 For Technical Reviewers

End-to-end ML pipeline (preprocessing → feature engineering → modeling → explainability)

Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Optuna, SHAP, LIME

Deployment: Flask / Streamlit / Docker

Reproducibility: Version-controlled Jupyter Notebooks



---

🪄 Innovation Highlights

💡 Classifier → Recommender: Converts income classification into donor recommendation.

💡 SDI Metric: Custom index quantifying donation readiness.

💡 Explainable & Fair: Transparent decision-making via SHAP/LIME.

💡 NGO Integration: Real-world impact for non-profits and fundraising campaigns.
